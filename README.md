### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in labs helped me prepare for the assignment. I used last week's like button, search, and other CSS applications. The search bar took me time to complete because we were covering it in lab at the same time as I was working on it. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have liked to add a side bar to allow users to keep track of their favorites and watched movies. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo was great. I got constructive feedback and aspects that my peers liked.
